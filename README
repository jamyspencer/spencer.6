Unfortunately alomst all functionality isn't here. I've just had three days to work on this part time after finishing my other projects. Hopefully I'll get some partial credit. I was really stifled by the fact that my shared memory wasn't attaching correctly. No errors were thrown but children would write successfully, while main would only see blank structs. Also I spent alot of time trying to get randomness...even using the pid as a seed the children always get identical page requests....idk. I'll redo project 5 as I never turned it in for similar problems I'm having with this one.
